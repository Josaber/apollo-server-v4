# Apollo Server v4

## GraphQL

> This is the specification for GraphQL, a query language and execution engine originally created at Facebook in 2012 for describing the capabilities and requirements of data models for client-server applications. The development of this open standard started in 2015. This specification was licensed under OWFa 1.0 in 2017. The GraphQL Foundation was formed in 2019 as a neutral focal point for organizations who support the GraphQL ecosystem, and the GraphQL Specification Project was established also in 2019 as the Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC, GraphQL Series.
